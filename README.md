# Sitar Script ðŸŽ¶

Sitar Script is an advanced audio processing and note classification system designed specifically for sitar music. This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques, including CNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-GRU architectures, to analyze audio files, extract features, and classify sitar notes accurately.

## Features ðŸš€
- **Audio Feature Extraction**: Extracts MFCC, Chroma features, and detects onsets for precise note analysis.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes various architectures such as CNN, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-GRU for note classification, allowing flexibility and enhanced performance.
- **Preprocessing Tools**: Handles non-silent segment detection and feature scaling for efficient processing.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Accepts audio files as input and outputs the sequence of predicted sitar notes.
